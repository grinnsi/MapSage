# MapSage - A OGC API - Features Implementation

This Python package is a possible implementation of the [OGC API - Features standard](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/features/).

Currently only part 1 and 2 are supported.

## Requirements.

Python >= 3.13
Activated Python environment with gdal >= 3.10

## Installation & Usage

To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
pip3 install -r ./server/requirements.txt
PYTHONPATH=server 
python -u -m server
```
After startup the server runs on port 8000.

Open your browser at `http://localhost:8000/features/` to see the landing page of the features server.

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
docker-compose --profile prod up --build
```
This will build the application with a nginx reverse proxy and a postgresql database with postgis.
